On the days of the workshops you will get the following:
* a compressed file
* an IP number
* a passphrase

Let's see how to use them.


### Get ready with the SSH key

Assume the compressed file is named `rsa_bio.gz`.  It is a SSH key, *i.e.* a way to enforce security measures when connecting to remote computers such as cloud VMs.  

Download the file, then open up a shell terminal and change directory to the directory where you downloaded it:

```
$ cd <DIRECTORY WITH YOUR GZ FILE>
```
{: .bash}

Define a variable with the file name, without the `.gz` extension:

```
$ export KEY=<YOUR KEY FILE WITHOUT .GZ>
```
{: .bash}

Check that it's there:

```
$ ls $KEY.gz
```
{: .bash}

```
rsa_bio.gz
```
{: .output}

Now, uncompress it with `gunzip`:

```
$ gunzip $KEY.gz
```
{: .bash}

The file name has now lost the extension `.gz`. Use the following command to set appropriate access permissions:

```
$ chmod 600 $KEY
```
{: .bash}


### Connect to the VM on the Nimbus cloud

### Linux/macOS

You can keep on going on the terminal, in the directory where you have the SSH key.  

You'll use the command `ssh` to connect.  
It's time to use the IP address you got; it's a string made up of four numbers separated by dots, such as `123.123.123.123`.

Assuming you're in the directory containing the SSH key, this is the full command (macOS users, use `-Y` rather than `-X`):

```
$ ssh -i $KEY -X ubuntu@<YOUR IP ADDRESS>
```
{: .bash}

You should get an output like:

```
The authenticity of host '146.118.65.140 (146.118.65.140)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:f4IZsAASIbZvC/Q+MN32F9jCEdvFwp5hDw9YoB7ClQw.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? 
```
{: .output}

Reply `yes` and press `Enter`.

Now, you will get asked a passphrase:

```
Enter passphrase for key 'rsa_bio':
```
{: .output}

Type the one you got communicated, and press `Enter`.

You should now get a new prompt starting with `ubuntu`... you're in the Nimbus VM!

**Note**: the flags `-X`/`-Y` are used to enable X11 forwarding for one exercise in the session on graphical applications.  If you get errors related to *X11 forwarding* let us know.


#### Windows

You can use MobaXterm, Visual Studio Code or PuTTY to connect.
