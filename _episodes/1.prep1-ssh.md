> Follow these steps to connect to your Nimbus virtual machine:
>
> 1. Save the ssh-key provided by the instructors in a known directory, for example `$HOME/pawseyTraining`:
>    ~~~
>    yourLocalComputer$ cd $HOME/pawseyTraining
>    yourLocalComputer$ ls
>    ~~~
>    {: .bash}
>    
>    ~~~
>    cfd_key.gz
>    ~~~
>    {: .output}
>    
>    ~~~
>    yourLocalComputer$ gunzip cfd_cfd2020.gz
>    ~~~
>    {: .bash}
>    
>    ~~~
>    yourLocalComputer$ ls -lat
>    ~~~
>    {: .bash}

>    drwxr-xr-x+ 75 esp025  515598196  2400 26 May 08:08 ..
>    -rw-r--r--   1 esp025  515598196  3434 22 May 11:26 rsa_cfd2020
>    ~~~
>    {: .output}
>    
>    - The point of the process is for you to count with the file: `rsa_cfd2020` in a known location
>
> 2. Make sure that the ssh-key has read-write permissions **only for you**:
>
>    ~~~
>    yourLocalComputer$ chmod 600 rsa_cfd2020
>    yourLocalComputer$ ls -lat
>    ~~~
>    {: .bash}

>    drwxr-xr-x   4 esp025  515598196   128 26 May 08:11 .
>    drwxr-xr-x+ 75 esp025  515598196  2400 26 May 08:08 ..

> 3. Connect to the VM using that ssh-key:
>
>    - Choose an IP from the list of available VMs given by the instructors.
>
>    - The chosen IP address should be something like `123.123.123.123`
>
>    - Now, use the ssh-key to connect to the VM with that IP address (username is `ubuntu`):
>
>    ~~~
>    yourLocalComputer$ ssh -i rsa_cfd2020 ubuntu@123.123.123.123 
>    ~~~
>    {: .bash}
>
>    ~~~
>    Enter passphrase for key 'rsa_cfd2020':
>    ~~~
